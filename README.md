# DeepFake-Detection
This deepfake detection project uses an image dataset from Kaggle, organized into folders of real and fake images for training and testing. The model is trained to analyze facial features and detect subtle inconsistencies that indicate manipulation. By classifying images real or fake, this project aims to create a tool for identifying deepfakes.
